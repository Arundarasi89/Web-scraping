Such a low doctor-patient ratio results in most of the population without any access to proper healthcare facilities. The budding digital infrastructure covers the gaps created by the lack of quality hospital infrastructure and medical staff, allowing doctors to converse with patients in the far-flung rural areas, through telemedicine.\\nTelemedicine will be a major contributor to filling the current gaps in the healthcare industry, a some of the factors contributing to its growth are:\\n\\xa0Internet Connectivity:\\nAs internet connectivity in India is currently growing at a rapid pace of 45% as of 2021, this growth will help in further penetrating the market, thus reaching people in areas lacking healthcare facilities. This would avail quality health care services to the people, allowing for efficient and effective treatment of diseases prevalent in the area.\\nGrowing healthcare startups in India\\nThe rapid growth in Digital infrastructure has led to a booming increase in the number of healthcare startups present in India. These start-ups are dedicated to the development of disease tracking and prevention tools. Since most remote areas do not have proper medical facilities or are unable to afford quality healthcare services, these start-ups have developed tools that enable the in-need patients to connect with far-flung doctors to receive affordable medical advice without incurring huge transportation costs. Start-ups such as Practo and 1 MG provide delivery of medicines that are at times not easily available.\\nCloud-based and AI telehealth solutions provide tools for employees and companies. These tools help in understanding the onset of diseases, current analysis of the causal factors of prominent diseases, and the most prevalent diseases in the population. Such tools better analyze the causal factors and develop prominent solutions for prevention, thus helping in better disease control for the organization and country.\\nCompanies such as Tata Digital Health provide cloud-based platforms for storing and understanding patient medical records and prescriptions. These help in understanding the track record of the patient, helping doctors to prescribe suitable medicines for the disease.\\nSelf-monitoring and Wearable technology\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe growing advancements in technology have enabled the creation of several wearable technologies which would help in better self-tracking of health. The onset of smart-watches and easily available medical devices has resulted in a better collection of medical data. Such devices would help understand the warning signs of certain medical diseases, analyze the trends in their progress and develop better solutions to prevent them.\\nThe increasing cost of medical facilities\\nWith the improvement of medical facilities, the cost of acquiring the facilities is also growing which the majority of the Indian population cannot afford. This issue can be resolved with the advancements of telemedicine which can reduce various expenses like travel for the people which people can utilize in availing better medical practitioners.\\nGovernment initiatives\\nThe resolution of the Indian government and various state governments to improve the healthcare facilities and make them accessible to the majority of the people has led them to launch various schemes like Ayushman Bharat which provides free health insurance to the bottom 50% of the population, and Mohalla Clinic, the initiative of Delhi government to provide free medical services for everyone.\\nLimitations:\\nLack of accuracy: ln doing online consultations the medical practitioners are not able to observe the patient properly they only have to go by what a patient tells them, which reduces the parameters of consideration for them to provide consultations.\\nLack of awareness and trust: Most of the population is not aware of these facilities or some of those are not able to trust the technology enough to avail it.\\nBlackcoffer Insights 40: Rishabh Sarkar and Aayushman Pratap Singh, Jagdish Sheth  School of Management\\n',\n"," 'How Telehealth and Telemedicine helping people to fight against COVID-19\\nThe last 2 years are the most critical time in the world and to survive in that time it’s a great challenge for people.

This online medicine service has also become popular. The people don’t need to be panicked to go out for this and they can provide the medicines to the patients at the home, and also store the necessary medicines on their own. The terms telehealth and telemedicine are used interchangeably. In remote areas to provide medicines and healthcare telehealth is used and to provide medicines at the doorsteps to the people telemedicine’s used. The technology is used for this clinic information. This technique is used for electronic communication and sharing the medicine’s information with the pharmacy directly. This concept is not new but in this situation, the use of this system has become very popular and also very useful.\\nDiscussion\\nCurrent scenario\\nIn every world, every government gives priority to telehealth and telemedicine technology. This thing started with the medicine library, which provides the necessary medicine and also gives an idea of the use of every medicine. This technique is used for electronic communication and sharing the medicine’s information with the pharmacy directly. In every remote area, this technology provides a great role. To support the teleconnection activity department of information technology has set a standard for that so that people can use this in this critical situation.\\nImplementation\\nTelehealth and telemedicine are different things, but the aim and purpose of these two technologies are the same, to provide healthcare services to people without any problem. This system is used for both the patient and healthcare professional education also for the public(Leite,2018). This technology aims to overcome the barriers and provide equal access to the services and the interventions. This technology helps to overcome the barrier and solve problems like adverse weather and illness. Telehealth technology is used to consult with the patient’s family about diagnosis and treatment by the service.\\nMarketing Strategies\\nThe telehealth system provides the patient’s information to various locations to provide the patient with the best treatment. This system is accessed by every unavailable service for the patient in every remote area. Telehealth removes the travel time and waiting rooms for the patients to the remote areas. for this technique, the patients can get safe ety and are too ill to travel in restricted areas.\\xa0 This technology is not dependent on locations, it can work in every location. This marketing for this technology is very popular in the market and people also love to use this technology.\\nBenefit\\n\\xa0This is the benefit of this technology. This technology can manage the health of the patients by self-management and through monitoring. The patients can go for a checkup in time when they can choose this thing that always gives a benefit to the patients. There are more opportunities to improve standard care with various technologies. This is more equitable to access healthcare. The clients can use the medical images for diagnosis and they can tell the doctors about their problems through video calls. If the case is very serious they don’t wait to check the doctor they can directly connect with the doctors through video calls. But in other ways, it causes some problems for the patients. With this technology they can meet various doctors each time, these things can create confusion for the patients and their families. The older patients and the child does have a family member with them for their health purpose. The patient’s and the doctor’s communication is needed to be good and they need to understand this is a part of the therapy. If they do not communicate with each other, the problem will take a long time to resolve. The most important thing is that the patient and the therapist need to use the technology properly. In time this technology will help people in many ways like that.\\nFuture Scopes\\nThis technology has the scope to be more popular in the future. After the covid-19 situation, this technology became very popular so the care delivery services that connect the patient to the health professionals to provide using the video calls and texting, and many more. For this, accessible and affordable health care is born as people’s care. Today telehealth is bigger than everything (Ramettaet al .2019).\\xa0 The services provide the patients to use this properly and get their therapy not to go to the clinic and can use these things as a lucky chance for their family and also.\\nConclusion\\nPatients always appreciate this technology and agree that this technology always helps them a lot and this is a good review to proceed with these things in the future. The most common reason is to provide the technology everywhere to the GP technology which is easy to locate the patient’s position to access them in various conditions.\\xa0 Proper communication is when the GP system is working properly and it has the locking time that causes problems so that the two parties have every mall chance to face any problem.\\xa0 With this technology, people can have courage and faith in their life. So they believe in this system nowadays. After surviving this critical situation they are already using this in daily life. So the purpose of building this system is to reach their level and be successful to achieve its purpose.\\nBlackcoffer Insights 40: Pranavitha.V, WOXSEN UNIVERSITY\\n',\n"," 'Is telemedicine effective in treating patients?\\nTelemedicine, which allows patients and doctors to communicate through video or phone, is beneficial to both their health and their convenience. More healthcare providers are now allowing patients to “see” them through computers or smartphones.\\nTelemedicine has become more accessible thanks to advances in technology, even for those who are not computer adept. Patients can request a virtual visit with many Johns Hopkins doctors, practitioners, and therapists through the MyChart online platform or mobile app.\\nTelemedicine technology has access to various treatment options, including primary care consultations, psychotherapy, physical therapy, and many more.\\nThis makes clinics more appealing to the growing number of patients who prefer telemedicine as their primary care provider. It’s a simple and cost-effective strategy to help patients with serious diseases manage their disease, participate in their treatment, and avoid problems from worsening.\\nTelemedicine offers many advantages:\\nEase and Convenience\\nWhen you’re unwell, telemedicine eliminates the need to drive to the doctor’s office or clinic, park, stroll, or wait in a waiting room. From the comfort of your bed or sofa, you can consult with your doctor. Virtual visits may be more convenient for you to fit into your hectic schedule. Depending on your schedule, you may not even need to take time off work or arrange child care with telemedicine.\\nControl of infectious sickness\\nDoctors can use telehealth consultations to pre-screen patients for probable infectious diseases to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, flu, and other infectious diseases. It also eliminates the need for unwell people to visit the office. Everyone benefits from less exposure to other people’s germs, particularly those who are chronically unwell, pregnant, and elderly.\\nHealthier assessment\\nSome specialized practitioners may benefit from telemedicine because they can see you in your own home. Allergists, for example, may be able to spot triggers in your environment that cause allergies. Neurologists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists can examine your abilities to maneuver and care for yourself at home. Telemedicine can also be used for mental health evaluations and counseling.\\nFamily associates\\nWhen seeing your doctor, it’s usually beneficial to have a family member present to assist you in providing information, asking questions, and taking notes on your doctor’s responses. If you authorize it, telemedicine can bring your family member in on the virtual visit if they live out of town or even across the nation.\\nCost-effective\\nTelemedicine is a more cost-effective method of healthcare administration as compared to traditional methods. This is true since doctors and patients do not need to travel every time they see a doctor or patient. In addition, video consultations are often less expensive than in-person consultations, allowing you to save money on travel and hospital setup. Additionally, using online booking and video conferencing as part of a healthcare solution saves money. This is especially important in locations where patients may have difficulty getting to a hospital for medical treatment.\\nTelemedicine also contributes to the expansion of the medical industry’s horizons. Studies, science, and advancement in this sector are now more widely available. Medical students’ education and training can be streamlined with the help of video conferencing.\\nTrack patient for medication\\nProviders and other healthcare professionals can use telemedicine technology to track when and how their patients take their medications. Physicians will soon use high-tech medical equipment to track their patients’ well-being over large distances. By communicating data from one system to another, this technology allows information such as pulse rhythm, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more to be transmitted. Telemedicine may be beneficial in this aspect because older persons are more likely to fail to take their prescriptions\\n\\xa0Tele dentistry\\nThis technology improves dental treatment by allowing dentists to collect images or other relevant evidence of teeth, dentures, and other dentistry parts to analyze and transfer it to another practitioner for evaluation. The ability to share records among dentists and dental experts to determine if a certain treatment is required is a significant benefit of telemedicine in dentistry. Specialists may also aid dentists in identifying problem areas and advising patients on how to avoid costly and complex procedures by prescribing preventive measures. This relationship, like other telemedicine applications, benefits those living in rural or underdeveloped locations who might not otherwise have access to medical specialists.\\nBetter service for clinicians and patients\\nTelemedicine is rapidly expanding, with numerous advantages for both physicians and patients. Any healthcare provider’s top priority is to provide improved patient care, which telemedicine technologies will help physicians achieve while also supporting them in refining and improving their private practices. As a result, establishing medical video conferencing solutions in a medical setting is crucial to improving medicine. The gap barrier is a well-known cause in the telemedicine industry. This is owing to the critical scarcity of trained healthcare providers around the world. This technology can readily fill the gap in the doctor shortage.\\nDigital health monitoring\\nTelemedicine systems with digital health monitoring capabilities will deliver more accurate diagnosis and treatment suggestions when paired with artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the use of video conferencing tools and machine learning technologies, the algorithm will be refined to deliver a better diagnosis for each patient. Telemedicine is a means of using networking devices to connect physicians in one region with patients in another. In-person meetings can be replaced by appointment, review, and photography transcript software. It allows doctors and patients to stay safe in the event of a pandemic while also allowing medical services to be expanded digitally.\\nReduce face to face meetings\\nTelemedicine can be used for a variety of purposes. Face-to-face meetings are unavoidable in some instances, but they can be easily avoided by utilizing modern technology. This has its own set of benefits that improve the hospital’s overall efficiency. Telemedicine, on the other hand, allows healthcare providers to monitor multiple patients at the same time without having to leave the hospital. Telemedicine allows for appointments and supervision, which helps decrease overcrowding in emergency rooms and provide care for patients in more essential situations. With the help of telemedicine, hospitals can exchange medical information and provide care even more promptly. Finally, it provides care for individuals who require supervision, which helps to lower overall health risks.\\nTelemedicine is much of the time used to connect specialists working with a patient in one spot while specialists are in one more to help them through telecom. This is profoundly advantageous to remote or challenging to arrive at regions where specialists are not promptly open. Performing remote visits at a lesser expense and time are utilized. The appearance of modern times achieved critical enhancements in the act of telemedicine. The rise of this shrewd innovation is prepared to do top-notch video web-based made ready for distant Healthcare to be conveyed to patients in their families, workplaces, or helped living places as an option to in-person arrangements for both essential and expert consideration. Many individuals say that telemedicine has existed here and there or one more since the phone was imagined. One can send pictures rather than information over the handset. Telemedicine is additionally an acknowledged part of how Healthcare is given in different nations. It has an astounding number of uses, which permits patients to design a subsequent arrangement by video, further develops consistency with aftercare visit rules, and lessens the tension between the two patients and specialists.\\nModern mobile health apps enable telemedicine and connect software to an interactive clinical interface. Noncritical occurrences include the treatment of patients with mild disorders, the exchange of data research information, and imaging findings. Patients can also use a dedicated app to buy medications and acquire prescriptions. Close collaboration with payment gateways is essential. Real-time analyses and information transmission are carried out here. Patients and clinicians can easily interact via a single app to talk and exchange data because these telemedicine technologies are frequently connected. Direct patient data can be simply obtained and forwarded to the appropriate clinician. A transcript of an appointment or a test report kept in an Electronic Health Record system folder could be used as evidence. Furthermore, it enables doctors to interpret data once it is collected.\\nTelemedicine uses emerging networking systems, application software for communication and file management, and advanced devices such as computers and mobile devices to view and control health care facilities. We can use an online patient portal to view our medical reports, and appointments, order prescription refills, pay for them or contact the doctor. A forward-thinking school collaborates with doctors to provide remote school visits. The provider may assess the seriousness of the problem and give guidance or reassurance to the parents. Residents in assisted living facilities have also been seen using telemedicine to stay out of the hospital. On-call physicians can use telemedicine to conduct a virtual visit to determine whether a patient needs to be admitted to a clinic that is located far away. Several telehealth solutions are now accessible to help manage health care and receive treatment.\\nTelemedicine, a well-known example of IoT in healthcare, should be user-friendly, adaptive, and accessible. The design of computer hardware should be simple and appealing to both patients and healthcare providers. Furthermore, the technology should be easy to integrate into existing healthcare systems. Another thing to keep in mind is that consumers will want instructions for the system to function properly. Healthcare organizations should take advantage of the Internet of Things to develop telemedicine apps that are reliable, cost-effective, and easy to use. These healthcare systems monitor and record the user’s vital signs over time. Depending on the user’s overall health, several of this equipment can also predict impending diseases. The goal of adopting an IoT-powered system isn’t just to keep track of patients.\\nTelemedicine is now used in medical areas such as dermatology, mental health, medicine, and cardiology to deliver improved treatment to populations underserved by doctors and clinics. It is often thought to be a way to minimize significantly the expense of treating health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and sleep apnea, which benefit from continuous observation of a patient’s condition. Telemedicine technology in recovery tackles these problems in various areas, including performing cognitive or psychiatric assessments, leading group counseling meetings, supplying patients with internet services, and remotely observing patients. For example, this technology will help people recover from lung disease by undergoing video therapy sessions and supervised physical recovery at a local satellite site. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death worldwide. However, many incidents can be avoided with the aid of drug therapies or social/lifestyle changes.\\nBlackcoffer Insights 40: Vinodh Korlepara and Y Giri Meghana, Woxsen University (Telangana)\\r\\n',\n"," 'The Future of Telehealth Services\\nTelemedicine refers to a specific set of clinical treatments, while telehealth encompasses a wide range of remote healthcare services. These are some of them:\\nPrimary care in a rural setting\\nServices for mental health\\nServices that are not clinical (e.g., provider training and continuing medical education)\\nTelehealth is defined as “the use of electronic information and communications technology to support long-distance clinical health care, patient & professional wellbeing education, public health, and health administration,” according to the Health Resources Services Administration.\\nTelehealth refers to a wide range of services delivered via a variety of telehealth platforms. Patients can get mental health help by sending confidential text messages to a counselor using the app, video conferencing with a primary care physician about new health issues, or attending a Zoom meeting about local public health programs.\\nForms of Telehealth Technologies-\\nSynchronous Communication\\nPatients and providers can communicate in real-time via phone or live audio and video with synchronous communication. A computer, smartphone, or tablet can be used for synchronous communication.\\nIn some situations, a patient’s vital signs or tests may be taken by an in-person healthcare provider (e.g., ultrasounds). The provider then uses telehealth technologies to provide the information to a remote member of the healthcare team in real-time (e.g., a doctor, nurse, or medical assistant).\\nAsynchronous Communication\\nAsynchronous communication makes use of “store and forwards” technology, which allows patients and clinicians to collect data (such as notes, photos, and metrics) now and reply to and evaluate it later. Many patient portals and apps use encrypted, secure messaging for enhancing asynchronous communication.\\nRemote Patient Monitoring\\nRemote patient monitoring allows doctors to keep an eye on a patient’s clinical parameters (such as insulin levels for diabetes monitoring) from afar. It can be synchronous (real-time) or asynchronous (not real-time).\\nPatients are seeking and receiving treatment and care in new ways because of telehealth technologies. Patients can now communicate with healthcare providers in real-time, receive answers to their questions, receive prescriptions, send photos and messages through encrypted chat portals, and keep track of their medical records wirelessly through cloud sharing programs — all without ever having to visit a physical health facility.\\nTelehealth services promote public health during pandemics by allowing patients to receive care while adhering to social distancing requirements. These services may be a safer option for primary care physicians because they may be successful in reducing COVID-19 exposure.\\nFurthermore, videoconferencing has the potential to ease the strain on healthcare facilities caused by patient demand. The use of personal protection equipment by healthcare personnel is reduced as a result of this (PPE). Telehealth has therefore aided healthcare systems in providing care while reducing risk.\\nTelehealth has several potential applications outside of a pandemic that is here to stay. Telehealth has the ability to:\\nProvide access to preventative and regular care to help maintain continuity of care.\\nIncrease access for patients with mobility issues (e.g., the elderly) and those who reside distant from usual service locations (e.g., rural patients)\\nIn many circumstances, connect patients with care providers faster than traditional offerings.\\nProvide coaching and support to individuals with chronic illnesses, such as nutrition guidance and weight loss.\\nProviders should be able to follow up with patients (e.g., recently hospitalized patients)\\nAllow clinical measurements to be monitored by care teams (including the patient and their team of healthcare providers) (e.g., blood pressure or blood glucose levels)\\nPeer-to-peer training should be provided to healthcare providers regularly.\\nFurthermore, patients may find that using telehealth services makes it easier to keep track of their medical data and measures. A person with a family history of heart disease, for example, may use wearable technology (such as a smartwatch with a built-in pedometer and heart rate monitor) to measure their daily exercise and blood pressure, saving their data in a health monitoring app and sharing it with their doctor.\\nTelehealth increases patients’ autonomy and access to critical healthcare services in a variety of ways. Similarly, telehealth technology assists providers in reaching out to underserved communities, such as patients in rural locations.\\nTelehealth Platforms\\nTelehealth has a bright future. Patients and providers have more methods to connect than ever before, thanks to the abundance of apps and software packages available.\\nFrom large telehealth software suites to simple apps, telehealth platforms cover the spectrum. The following three examples are just a few of the many telehealth options that are expected to grow in the coming years\\nTelemedicine Suites\\nThese software packages connect patients with clinicians by combining different technologies at the same time. Mend, for example, sends text-based appointment reminders, provides online forms, simplifies patient scheduling, and supports audio and video calling.\\nBrowser-Based Software Apps\\nThese apps run in a web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) and allow patients and clinicians to communicate in a HIPAA-compliant manner. Doxy. me, for example, offers free, safe, and unlimited chat and video communication, as well as subscription options with enhanced protection and encryption. It’s used for secure communications, such as telemedicine mental health therapy sessions.\\nHealth Monitoring Software\\nData from FDA-approved medical devices are coordinated using this software. Providers can use this technology to control wireless scales, blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, glucometer adapters, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices from a distance. For example, AMC health employs tracking and Bluetooth connectivity to allow remote devices to communicate biometric data, which patients and physicians may access and evaluate.\\nWhen telehealth initially became available, patients saw it as a less expensive option than in-person care. Because of the simplicity of telehealth, with the acceptance of technology came a willingness to participate. Remote patient monitoring was deployed in 61.2 percent of hospitals across the country in 2017.\\nTechnology improvements have led to even more robust telehealth visits, with video conferencing options, wider access to broadband internet, and simple ways to collect biometric data. In 2005, there were 206 yearly telehealth visits among one insurance carrier’s subscribers, which climbed to 202,374 visits in 2017. Patients, medical practitioners, and healthcare facilities are increasingly appreciating the benefits, effectiveness, and convenience of telehealth sessions, and they are asking them more frequently.\\nFor many people, fitness trackers, smartwatches, and other sorts of wearable technology have become indispensable. Wearers can monitor their health statistics, such as heart rate, sleep, and mobility, with these gadgets. It’s considerably easier for wearers to share their health data with their primary care physician when they have quick access to it.\\nBecause almost everyone now has access to the internet and a device that can connect to it, such as a smartphone, telehealth services have never been more accessible. More mobile devices may now connect without being interrupted by speed concerns, thanks to the spread of 5G services1. Patients and clinicians can view each other’s facial expressions and have more in-depth dialogues about health issues and experiences through video conferencing. This engagement is popular globally for both patients and medical practitioners now that telehealth services are more widely available.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly significant in telehealth. AI is used by medical professionals to assist with diagnosis and administrative tasks. Because most AI devices can be managed by triage nurses, doctors can see more patients with AI diagnoses and tests.\\nAI can also help with maintaining and sorting complete and accurate medical records. Doctors can electronically communicate their patient records to medical professionals thousands of miles distant. Medical providers can analyze considerable information about a patient’s background before making a diagnosis by using AI for administrative activities.\\nPeople use telehealth services in a variety of ways without even realizing it. One approach to take use telehealth services is to phone an emergency line or a poison control hotline to request treatment or guidance.\\nThe telehealth sector has developed to cover a variety of clinical services in addition to emergency treatments, such as:\\nMental health therapy: Because mental health counseling necessitates in-depth discussions, it naturally adapts to telehealth. Patients may feel more comfortable engaging in these conversations from home, thus many counselors, psychiatrists, and psychologists provide telemedicine sessions.\\nDoctor’s visits: Some patients prefer telehealth doctor’s visits over dealing with scheduling issues or logistics for an in-office visit. A doctor may be able to identify a non-serious sickness, such as a cold or the flu, by reviewing a patient’s medical history and present symptoms.\\nPatients with medical issues may require consultations with specialists who can assess their symptoms. In some situations, instead of visiting the office, these patients may be able to meet with physicians electronically via a telehealth session to acquire a diagnosis and treatment plan.\\nAnalysis of lab or x-ray results: Patients who require blood to be drawn or x-rays must go to a doctor’s office in person. They may not need to schedule a follow-up consultation with a specialist or doctor to discuss their findings. Because the majority of these meetings are focused on communication, they can be readily performed through virtual video conferences or phone calls.\\nHealth condition monitoring: Patients who have previously been diagnosed with a health issue may be able to monitor their condition without going to the doctor’s office. These patients have better visibility into their health parameters because of wearable technology that analyses their sleeping patterns, heart rate, and mobility. They can talk to their doctor over the phone or via video chat about complications, symptoms, or health changes.\\nMany healthcare services do not require in-person visits, allowing the telehealth industry to grow and provide more patients with conventional medical treatment.\\nIn the healthcare industry, mobile health, often known as mHealth, has also become commonplace. The use of cellphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic storage and communication devices by medical professionals are referred to as mobile health. These technologies let healthcare staff organize, store, and analyze patient data.\\nWearable technology is classified as mHealth since it is used by both adults and children to assess health data. Doctors can use data from fitness trackers and smartwatches with health apps to check patient symptoms remotely.\\nInsurance companies are increasingly willing to cover telehealth services now that they have acquired popularity and demonstrated their efficacy. For example, virtual check-ins with patients, e-visits, and mental health condition therapies are all covered by Medicare.\\nInsurance coverage and telehealth sessions are governed by state laws. Patients may be asked to pay out-of-pocket and then be reimbursed for all or part of the telemedicine session in some instances. Except in Rhode Island, all states mandate insurance carriers to provide some telehealth coverage.\\nTelehealth has become a significant element of the healthcare sector as a handy and straightforward approach to diagnosing, assessing, and treating patients. With these recent advancements, telehealth technology continues to grow and become a useful tool for medical professionals.\\nBlackcoffer Insights 40: Uday Kovuri\\n']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for n, i in enumerate(value, 1):\n","    with open('text_files/new{}.txt'.format(n), 'a') as f:\n","        f.write(i)"],"metadata":{"id":"gfa8N958e8lN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"wGTcfIpwe9sp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"xnvmfvhhe9vd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"CkT41WkNe9yA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"CubJJRFuRHF-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# This will read a text file, normalize it and remove stopwords from it using nltk.\n","import nltk, io, math\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from string import punctuation\n","\n","# Read raw text\n","targetFile = open('input_text.txt')\n","rawtext = targetFile.read()\n","\n","# Remove punctuation\n","def strip_punctuation(s):\n","    return ''.join(c for c in s if c not in punctuation)\n","filtered_punc = strip_punctuation(rawtext)\n","print(filtered_punc)\n","\n","# Removing stopwords\n","stops = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","filtered_text = [i for i in filtered_punc.lower().split() if i not in stops]\n","\n","# Count Number of words\n","total_words = len(filtered_text)\n","\n","# Divide them equally into 10 different lists\n","chunk_size = math.floor(total_words/10)\n","n_lists_of_words = [filtered_text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(filtered_text), chunk_size)]\n","if(len(n_lists_of_words) > 10):\n","    del n_lists_of_words[-1]\n","\n","# Lets make list of strings instead of list of lists\n","list_of_str = [' '.join(x) for x in n_lists_of_words]\n","\n","# Print list values in seperate files\n","for index, word in enumerate(list_of_str):\n","    with open(\"Output\" + str(index) + \".txt\", \"w\") as text_file:\n","        print(word, file=text_file)\n","Sh"],"metadata":{"id":"rZaztEl2RHIv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"6m2qRIiFRHLW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"k0dfDUngRHOK"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"SShRb2X6Hxv1"},"outputs":[],"source":["with open(name, 'x') as f:\n","        f.write(text)\n","        f.write('\\n')\n","        f.close()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Rng_-cfyCV4Y"},"outputs":[],"source":["with open(name, 'w') as f:\n","      f.write(content)\n","      f.write('\\n')\n","      f.close()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ydTY2q7yCV8J"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"s5HIA0i9CV_L"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"JqNO7AD7CWBS"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6yh2mghXCWDX"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ntsjCR6uCM41"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"7Nt9wINTCM6-"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"38AtnaGJ83Gd"},"outputs":[],"source":["for links in df['URL']:\n","    headers = {'User-Agent': \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11;
